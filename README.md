# Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using DFS (C++)

This is a simple C++ implementation to detect a cycle in a directed graph using Depth-First Search (DFS) and recursion.

## 👨‍💻 Algorithm Used
- Directed Graph (Adjacency List)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Backtracking
- Recursion Stack

## ✅ Output
- `"Cycle detected in the graph!"` if a cycle exists
- `"No cycle in the graph."` if the graph is acyclic

## 📂 How to Run

```bash
g++ cycle_detector.cpp -o cycle_detector
./cycle_detector
